# Beethoven's ninth

Beethoven's ninth, a piece commonly known, can have a lot of different meanings for different persons. Some people only find the music soothing and beautiful, while other people use it as an identifier, since it's the anthem of the European Union. Considering this year has brought us Brexit and realising that Beethoven was born 250 years ago this year, gave me a good reason to investigate this masterpiece of a symphony.
On Spotify there are countless of different versions of this piece. All performed by different conductors with different orchestras. I wanna know what the differences are between these versions. Performing a classical piece like this one doesn't come with a lot of freedom in interpretation. I wonder whether Spotify statistics are able to identify the small differences between versions. 
To investigate this i implemented the data of 40 different versions (not all of them) in R.
